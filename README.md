Facilitating funding for non-profit organisations through artificial intelligence 

Our initial goal is to create a zero fee automated investing strategy for non-profit organisations to maximize long term growth of non-profit funds at no additional cost. 
This will fascilitate the a longer term postive effect of charitable funds for organisations aimed at improving social welfare.
