Facilitating funding for non-profit organisations through artificial intelligence 

Our initial goal is to create a zero fee automated investing strategy for non-profit organisations to maximize long term growth of non-profit funds at no additional cost. 
This will fascilitate the a longer term postive effect of charitable funds for organisations aimed at improving social welfare.

# Currently Running Experiments
## 1. ARIMA Modeling (Autoregressive integrated moving average)
ARIMA models have historically shown proficiency at time-series prediction so this is our baseline.
## 2. Deep Reinforcement Learning: Deep Q-Learning
Using deep Convolutional Neural Networks to train AI on trading decision making. Showing reasonably accurate results, but further optimisation needed to get consistent real world results.
## 3. Deep Reinforcement Learning: Deep Q-Learning with LSTM
Audmenting a Deep Q-Learning NN with a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network: Still in Development
## 4. Bayesian augmented ARIMA
Conceptual Stage
